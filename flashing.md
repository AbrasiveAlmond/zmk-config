# Flash firmware
Reset the microcontroller then it should appear as a drive on your computer, drag and drop the corresponding firware file (.uf2) to flash it.
The firmware files can be found as artifacts from GH actions.

[Note] 
  For split keyboards, only the central (left) side will need to be reflashed if you are just updating your keymap. More troubleshooting information for split keyboards can be found here.
